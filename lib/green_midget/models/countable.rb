# This is an abstraction from Words, Examples and Features. It provides common
# methods for building the record keys for individual countables in any
# category.
#
# For example the data record key for the word 'legit' in Spam category would
# be something like "word::legit::spam_count". The record key for a feature
# 'url_present' in Ham would be something like "feature::url_present::ham_count"
# The count of all training examples given for category Spam would be
# "example::any::spam_count"
#
# The example counts for individual features is stored as well. For example for
# 'url_present' we will have two records: "example::url_present::spam_count" and
# "example::url_present::ham_count". They will store the informatino about how
# much training the GreenMidget received for this feature in each category.
#
# This class is the link between countable and the Records data store adapter
#
